# securicad-enterprise-auxiliary

A repository for auxiliary tools  for securiCAD Enterprise.

These scripts are meant to ease customer deployment of environment specific functions related to securiCAD Enterprise, e.g., backup/restore to cloud storage. 

Currently only for azure environments, but AWS is on the roadmap. 

As it stands, we don’t have a Contributors License Agreement in place, so we cannot accept non-trivial pull requests.
